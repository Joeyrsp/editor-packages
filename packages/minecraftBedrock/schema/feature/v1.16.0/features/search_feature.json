	"description": "Sweeps a volume searching for a valid placement location for its referenced feature. The 'search_volume' field specifies the axis-aligned bounding box that defines the boundaries of the search. The search sweeps along the axis defined by the 'search_axis' field, layer by layer. For example, if 'search_axis' = '-x', blocks with greater x values will be checked before blocks with lower x values. Each layer is searched from the bottom-left to the top-right before moving to the next layer along the axis. By default, only one valid position must be found, but this can be altered by specifying the 'required_successes' field. If fewer than the required successes are found, no placement will occur.",
