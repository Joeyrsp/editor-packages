		"rotation_drag_coefficient": {
			"title": "Rotation Drag Coefficient",
			"description": "Drag applied to retard rotation equation is rotation_acceleration += -rotation_rate*rotation_drag_coefficient. Useful to slow a rotation, or to limit the rotation acceleration. Think of a disc that speeds up (acceleration) but reaches a terminal speed (drag). Another use is if you have a particle growing in size, having the rotation slow down due to drag can add 'weight' to the particle's motion",
